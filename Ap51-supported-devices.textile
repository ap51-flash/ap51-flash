h1. Overview about the devices which you can flash using ap51-flash


In general you can flash all devices which use the redboot bootloader that has the reflashing function enabled. ap51-flash will automatically detect redboot when you turn on the device. If your device is not in the "known to work" list which follows you still can try it and inform us about the result.

List of known to work redboot devices:

* FON, La Fonera (2100)
* Open Mesh, OM1P
* Engenius, EOC-1650, EOC-2610, EOC-2610p
* Engenius, 3660
* Dlink, DIR-300 (after installing a reflash-enabled redboot)
* Ubiquiti, Pico2 & HP
* UniAppliance Colibrì (!UniData)

ap51-flash also supports plain tftp flashing without redboot. This method is quite common amongst a variety of devices.

List of known to work tftp devices:

* Ubiquiti, NanoStation2
* Ubiquiti, NanoStation5
* Ubiquiti, Bullet2 & HP
* Ubiquiti, RouterStation

List of known to work uboot devices:

* Open Mesh, OM2P, MR500

Note: There are many different devices out there which differ slighty in their way of doing things. Even if your device does not work out of the box it might require only small changes to support it.


h2. Note on Mac OS X


If you need to use ap51 flash with OSX, please checkout version 252 and compile like this:

</code></pre>

Later versions lack Mac OS X support until someone adds it. If you feel you can close the gap, please contact us.
