= ap51-flash station for OpenWRT =

OpenWRT-package:
 * [attachment:Makefile]
 * [attachment:ap51-flash.conf files/ap51-flash.conf]
 * [attachment:ap51-flash.init files/ap51-flash.init]


Example configuration of a Dlink DIR-300 as a ap51-flash station:
 * minimal [attachment:.config]-file (kicking out a lot of the standard applications and modules to save as much RAM as possible and adding nfs-support for remote images)
 * [attachment:network /etc/config/network] (configuring ports 1-4 as seperate VLANS for flashing other devices and the WAN-port as the adminstration port)
 * [attachment:fstab /etc/fstab] (for mounting nfs-shares at boot time)

Example image (using the same config as stated above):
