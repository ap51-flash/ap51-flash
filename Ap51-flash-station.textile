h1. ap51-flash station for [[OpenWRT]]


[[OpenWRT]]-package:
* [attachment:Makefile]
* [attachment:ap51-flash.conf files/ap51-flash.conf]
* [attachment:ap51-flash.init files/ap51-flash.init]


Example configuration of a Dlink DIR-300 as a ap51-flash station:
* minimal [attachment:.config]-file (kicking out a lot of the standard applications and modules to save as much RAM as possible and adding nfs-support for remote images)
* [attachment:network /etc/config/network] (configuring ports 1-4 as seperate VLANS for flashing other devices and the WAN-port as the adminstration port)
* [attachment:fstab /etc/fstab] (for mounting nfs-shares at boot time)

Example image (using the same config as stated above):
* "2-port-vlan without host learning (hub-mode, for debugging ap51-flash)
* [attachment:network2 /etc/config/network":http://x-realis.dyndns.org/Freifunk/firmware/ap51-flash-station/]
* [attachment:switch-to-hub /etc/init.d/switch-to-hub]
